### Course: Practical Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)

#### Lesson 1:

- Paper Attention is all you need
- Auto-encoding, and auto-regression
- Embeddings: a way to represent words or phrases as machine-readeable numerical vectors in a multi-dimensional space



#### Lesson 2:

- About semantic search, exposed that prompt engineering feel like a bug.
- The order to apply changes to your LLM pipeline should be:
- prompt engineer
- rag optimization
- model fine-tuning.


#### Lesson 3:

- A good prompt should work across different LLM's.
- Few shot learning in context.
- Chain of thoughts. Reason along the the response.
- Designing RAG propmts for consistency.

#### Lesson 4:
